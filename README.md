## Introduction

This is a project that's really important to me and is a continuous work in progress. :) Essentially, it's a search tool for a user to find comedy shows happening near them based on their city! By entering the name of your city - a list of shows will display with name, date, time, address, and venue. There's also a "View On Map" button that will show you where the venue is located using Google Maps.

## Functionality

I used two different APIs: PredictHQ and Google Maps

PredictHQ is a very complex database that has a vast library of events that are happening all around the world. By filtering through the database, I was able to specify only comedy shows. I also had to filter through location and make that location searchable by the user.

Google Maps API was a bit easier to navigate. I installed the API (React makes it easy to install google maps) then I had to navigate through the vast library of Google API and figure out what exactly I needed. I was able to get a marker to place on the map!

## Going forward
