# Laugh Map

## Introduction

Laugh Map is a search tool for a user to find comedy shows happening near them at all times. By entering the name of your city - a list of shows will display with name, date, time, address, and venue. There's also a "View On Map" button that will show you where the venue is located using Google Maps.

### Initial wireframe:

## Functionality

I used two different APIs: PredictHQ and Google Maps

PredictHQ is a very complex database that has a vast library of events that are happening all around the world. I was able to integrate this API with Google Maps to display all the data on the page.

## Going forward

This is a project that's really important to me and is a continuous work in progress. :) There's so much more I want to do with it. I plan on making an extra search bar for specific dates, a clickable calendar tool, a markercluster with Google Maps, and a separate route for people to post their own fliers for shows!
